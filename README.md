Calculates the following statistics for the selected text:

* word count,
* the number of words beginning with a capital letter,
* number of words written in capital letters,
* the number of lowercase words
* number of numbers (not digits),
* the sum of all numbers (not digits) in the text.

The program displays a simple bar graph that will represent the frequency of different word lengths in the text.
